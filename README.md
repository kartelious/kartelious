### Hello there,
#### or as I like to say [bone jaw](https://oli-sharratt.me/projects/bone-jaw/)

### Who am I?
I'm a design-focused student, who embarks on random and seemingly uncoordinated endeavours for the betterment of my own abilities. I appreciate designs that incorporate great functionality in a simple easy-to-use package, and in particular I desire efficiency in what I create and use (not to say that it is always achieved).
*TL;DR: Some random person on the internet doing things on the internet because it's the internet and that's what it's for.*

### What do I do?
Many, probably too many, different things - from computing and electronics, to music and design. I seem to hate having time to relax, but I guess when there are things that need to be done, I'll get them done.
